# RC-BFK

This is not really a source repo as it is a test of the github, and a way for me to keep track of feature requests and bugs in my RC-NFK android App.

I could easily upload the code, and I might do that, but the App is really only a WenView interface to a mobile interface developed in html.

I am hoping that I will be able to record bugs inhere, and keep track of my progress.

We will see how it turns out.
